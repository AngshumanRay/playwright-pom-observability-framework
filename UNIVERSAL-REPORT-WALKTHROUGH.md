| **Top Violations List** | Ranked list of the most common violations with: occurrence count (colored by severity), rule ID, impact badge, and human-readable description |

### WCAG Rules Checked

When using the observability fixture, these accessibility rules are automatically scanned on every test:

| Rule ID | What It Checks |
|---------|----------------|
| `image-alt` | All images must have alternative text |
| `button-name` | Buttons must have discernible text for screen readers |
| `heading-order` | Heading levels must be sequential (h1 → h2 → h3, not h1 → h3) |
| `label` | All form inputs must have associated labels |
| `landmark-one-main` | Page must have exactly one `<main>` landmark |
| `region` | All page content must be contained within landmark regions |
| `color-contrast` | Text must have sufficient color contrast against its background |
| `link-name` | Links must have discernible text (not just "click here") |

### Severity Definitions

| Severity | Meaning | Action Required |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Critical** | Users with disabilities are completely blocked from accessing content | Must fix before release |
| **Serious** | Users face significant barriers; some functionality is inaccessible | Should fix before release |
| **Moderate** | Users experience difficulty but can still access content with workarounds | Fix in next sprint |
| **Minor** | Best practice recommendations; does not block access | Add to backlog |

**💬 Customer talking point:** *"This tab ensures your application meets WCAG accessibility standards. A score of 100 means zero violations detected across all pages tested. Critical and serious violations should be addressed before release — they represent real barriers for users who rely on screen readers, keyboard navigation, or other assistive technologies."*

---

## 9. Tab 7 — 🌐 Browsers

**Purpose:** Compare test results and performance across different browsers.

### Charts (2)

| Chart | What It Shows |

### Comparison Table

| Column | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Browser** | Name (chromium, firefox, webkit, edge) |
| **Score** | Benchmark score for that browser |
| **Tier** | Quality tier badge (Elite → Critical) |
| **Tests** | Count of tests run on this browser |
| **Pass Rate** | Percentage that passed on this browser |
| **Avg Duration** | Mean test execution time |
| **P95** | 95th percentile duration (worst-case timing) |
| **Requests** | Total network requests made on this browser |
| **Avg Resp** | Mean API response time on this browser |
| **A11y** | Number of accessibility violations on this browser |

**💬 Customer talking point:** *"This tab answers the question: 'Does our application work equally well across all browsers?' If Firefox shows a lower pass rate or slower speeds than Chromium, that's a targeted area for investigation. The radar chart makes cross-browser gaps visually obvious."*

## 10. Scoring System

### Benchmark Score (0–100)

Each test gets a benchmark score computed from three weighted factors:

| Weight | Factor | How It's Calculated |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| **40%** | Speed | Duration < 2s = score 100. Duration > 15s = score 0. Linear between. |
| **40%** | Reliability | Passed = 100, Skipped = 50, Failed = 10. Minus 15 points per retry. |
| **20%** | Accessibility | No violations = 100. Penalized: critical × 4 + serious × 3 + moderate × 2 + minor × 1. |

### Overall Suite Score

The suite-level benchmark uses:

| Weight | Factor |
|--------|--------|
| 35% | Pass rate (target: 100%) |
| 30% | Average duration (target: < 2s) |
| 20% | Failure count (target: 0) |
| 15% | Throughput (target: ≥ 20 tests/min) |

### Tier Mapping

| Score Range | Tier | Badge Color | Meaning |
|-------------|------|-------------|---------|
| 90 – 100 | 🟢 **Elite** | Green | Production-ready, best-in-class quality |
| 75 – 89 | 🔵 **Strong** | Blue | Reliable, minor improvements possible |
| 60 – 74 | 🟡 **Stable** | Amber | Acceptable, some optimizations needed |
| 40 – 59 | 🟠 **Watch** | Orange | Needs attention, risks present |
| 0 – 39 | 🔴 **Critical** | Red | Immediate action required |

### Network Score (0–100)

| Weight | Factor |
|--------|--------|
| 40% | Request failure rate (target: 0%) |
| 30% | Average response time (target: < 200ms) |
| 30% | HTTP error count (target: 0) |

### Error Score (0–100)

| Weight | Factor |
|--------|--------|
| 50% | Console error count (target: 0) |
| 50% | Page error count (target: 0) |

### Observability Score (0–100)

| Weight | Factor |
|--------|--------|
| 60% | Network score |
| 40% | Error score |

### Security Score (0–100)

| Weight | Factor |
|--------|--------|
| 30% | Observability score |
| 30% | Pass rate |
| 40% | Absence of critical/high findings |

### Security Risk Levels

| Score Range | Risk Level | Meaning |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| 90 – 100 | **Low** | All clear — no significant issues |
| 70 – 89 | **Medium** | Minor issues present — review recommended |
| 40 – 69 | **High** | Significant concerns — action needed |
| 0 – 39 | **Critical** | Urgent remediation required |

### Accessibility Score (0–100)

Starts at 100 and is penalized:
```
penalty = (critical × 4) + (serious × 3) + (moderate × 2) + (minor × 1)
score = max(0, 100 - penalty × 5)
```

    ['./reporters/UniversalReporter.ts'],          // universal report
  ],
  use: {
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',   // embeds screenshots in report
    trace: 'retain-on-failure',      // shows trace links in report
  },
});
```

**Optional** — customize output location:

```typescript
['./reporters/UniversalReporter.ts', {
  outputDir: 'my-reports',        // default: Reports/universal-report
  outputFile: 'report.html',      // default: index.html

## 13. FAQ

### Q: Does this work without the observability fixture?

**Yes.** The reporter works with any Playwright project out of the box. Without the fixture:
- Dashboard, Tests, Performance, and Browsers tabs work fully
- Observability tab shows zeroes (clean state)
- Security tab shows 100/100 (no issues to report)
- Accessibility tab shows 100/100 (no scans to report)

To get full observability, security, and accessibility data, add the `observability.fixture.ts` to your project.

### Q: How are screenshots embedded?

Screenshots are encoded as base64 and embedded directly in the HTML. No external image files are needed. Configure screenshots in `playwright.config.ts`:

```typescript
use: { screenshot: 'only-on-failure' }
```

### Q: Can I share this report with someone?

Yes — it's a single `.html` file. Email it, upload to Slack/Teams, or host it on any web server. The only external dependency is the Plotly.js CDN for charts (loaded on first open).

### Q: What browsers are supported for viewing the report?

Any modern browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge. The report uses standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Q: Can I integrate this into CI/CD?

Yes. Add `npx playwright test` to your CI pipeline. The report is generated automatically. Common patterns:

- **GitHub Actions:** Upload `Reports/universal-report/` as an artifact
- **Jenkins:** Archive the `Reports/` directory
- **Azure DevOps:** Publish as a pipeline artifact

### Q: How large is the report file?

Typically 500 KB – 5 MB depending on:
- Number of tests (more tests = more data)
- Number of embedded screenshots (each adds ~50–200 KB)
- Number of browsers (more browsers = more comparison data)

### Q: What does "Elite" tier mean for our release?

Elite (90–100) means:
- Tests run fast (< 2 seconds average)
- All tests pass consistently
- No accessibility violations
- Backend responds quickly
- No console or page errors

This is the standard you should aim for before every production release.
